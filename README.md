# Speech-and-and-Audio-Engineering
 
This project used Matlab to devlop and evaluate a spech classification system to identify voiced and unvoiced speech as part of a masters level speech and audio engineering module.

The full system is implemented using MATLAB's and utilises the the open-source toolkit VOICEBOX. Speech samples used were from the TIMIT copus and processed as .wav files. Gaussian Mixture Models were used to devlop a simplistic machine learning algorithm for evaluating voiced and unvoiced samples.
